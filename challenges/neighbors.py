# The two attached data files contain measurement information for various dragons that were observed and studied.
# Unfortunately, due to a clerical error, one of the files does not have the dragon types listed.
#
# Based on a K Nearest Neighbors algorithm trained on the labeled dragon table, how many dragons in the
# other table are probably "Blue Dragons".
